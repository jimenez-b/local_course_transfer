# Course transfer #

----------


## Description ##
This plugin allows administrators to schedule course back-ups and restoration to a remote server.

A log system is available to see the progression of the backups/restores and the next scheduled processes

Note: The two Moodle servers have to share the same folder for the import/export to work. We suggest using an NFS.

## IMPORTANT ##
An exported role is available in the role folder. You must either import that role inot your Moodle system or create a new role based on the teacher role with the following parameters

	name: Course Transfer Override
	shortname: coursetransferoverride
	change capability viewhiddencourse to prohibit.

Save the role.
